# INFO 253A - Final Project

## Objective

### For this project you will accomplish the following:
- Build an API of your choosing with yourself and 4-5 other team members
- Learn how to collaborate to build a React application
- Show off your Front-End skills

### The project is split into three parts
1. Defining your project with your assigned team
2. Implementing your project idea, presenting to the class
3. And writing about it.

### Your team must complete the following:
1. Think of a front end web application that you would like to build
2. Build the front end web application that you came up with
3. Utilize at least one external API
4. Demo the front end web application and present it to the rest of the class
5. Submit a write-up that consists of a description and the purpose of your application and talks about the API that you used

## Part I - Project Brief

Note: _This will be 5% of your overall class grade._

- Interact with your assigned group and submit a project idea (by November 7th, 2022 - 11:59 PM) 
- One person on the team create the groupâ€™s Github repository, and the rest of the team joining the same repo
- Each team needs to come up with a web application that they would like to build and why. Also talk about the external API that you would be using. Here are some examples:
    - A game of chess
    - A localized weather application that displays the weather for each app based on the location you provide
    - An interactive UI for a music player
- What to put in your proposal?
    - Team name & your members
    - One paragraph to summarize your idea
    - What API you plan to use
- Push the initial proposal in a proposal.md file to your group project page on GitHub. Submit the GitHub repo link to bCourses (1 submission per team)
- We will take a look at initial drafts of the web application that you have chosen to build and comment on the feasibility of your project idea and return with comments

## Part II - Project Implementation

Note: _This will be 20% of your overall class grade._

This is the part where you implement your web application using REACT. Happy Coding!

- Each team will have one repository where they will push their changes. Please use this new repository for all work on this project.
- This could be the first time where you are using GitHub while collaborating with others. Beware of merge conflicts and editing the same file with someone else.
    - git pull often
- Commit all changes in the repo
- Prepare and deliver your project and a presentation
    - Prep for a 5 minute presentation
    - Limit your slides to 5 pages max. Demoing your application in-person is imperative.

## Part III - Project Documentation

Note: _This will be 5% of your overall class grade._

- Apart from the 5 slide presentation, make sure that your code is well commented.
- Write a 2 page document on what you did and name it LEARNINGS.md. This should contain the following:
    - Team name & your members
    - What was your original goal and how much of it were you able to achieve?
    - A description of what your project does and the functionality that it provides
    - What did you learn from the project? Talk about the mistakes you made, challenges you overcame or the tools that you got to learn etc
