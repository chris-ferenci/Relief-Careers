Our idea is to build a web application that displays international jobs and careers available in the humanitarian industry. Furthermore, we would like to integrate recent and ongoing disaster events into the application, with the goal of offering an experience for users to find jobs related to specific countries that are impacted by disasters. For this, we will use the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ReliefWeb API.

The ReliefWeb API is an API that was built by the United Nations that powers a mobile/low-bandwidth disaster information website. The endpoints provided by this API are reports, disasters, countries, jobs, training, sources, blogs, book, and references. We plan to use the jobs, countries, and disasters endpoints to provide a focused experience on finding jobs where they are needed the most.
